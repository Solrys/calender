## üîß Environment Variables Required:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Google Calendar Configuration
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account",...}
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-main-calendar-id
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID_WEBSITE=your-main-calendar-id  # Should be same as above
CALENDAR_WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/google-calendar-webhook
```

## üìä Stripe Dashboard Setup:

### Webhook Configuration:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook-stripe`
3. Listen for events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Testing Mode:
- Test with Stripe test keys first
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Verify webhook receives events in Stripe dashboard

## üêõ Known Potential Issues to Monitor:

1. **Calendar API Rate Limits**: Google Calendar API has rate limits
2. **Webhook Delays**: Stripe webhooks can have delays (usually < 5 seconds)
3. **Time Zone Edge Cases**: EST/EDT transitions in March/November
4. **Database Connection Issues**: MongoDB connection timeouts
5. **Concurrent Bookings**: Race conditions when multiple users book simultaneously

## üìù Logging to Check:

Look for these console messages:
- `‚úÖ Booking marked as success via webhook`
- `‚úÖ Google Calendar event created via webhook`
- `üßπ Cleaned up X abandoned pending bookings`
- `Excluding booking with status: pending`

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist:

- [ ] Update environment variables in production
- [ ] Configure Stripe webhook endpoint in production
- [ ] Test with real payment (small amount)
- [ ] Verify Google Calendar integration works
- [ ] Monitor server logs for errors
- [ ] Test manual calendar booking sync
- [ ] Verify abandoned booking cleanup works
